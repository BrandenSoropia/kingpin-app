## Skateparks Sources

Got all skatepark data from https://www.torontoskateboarding.com/skateboard-parks-directory.

## Tricks Sources

I did not write these descriptions. Took these descriptions from https://brailleskateboarding.com/learn-to-skate/skateboarding-trick-guide/. Personally, I live their tutorials, so I recommend checking them out!

Also got a few descriptions from https://www.skatedeluxe.com/blog/en/trick-tips/skateboard/flat/how-to-bs-180-ollie/.

Please let me know if any comments and concerns!
