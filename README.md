# Local Setup

Requirements:

- Node `v12.13.1`. Use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to help easily manage your Node versions!
- Yarn Classic `v.1.22.0`. [Get it from here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- Expo `3.22.1`. If it's your first time using Expo, its installation (including dependency installation for mobile simulators) are included in their [Getting Started Docs](https://docs.expo.io/get-started/installation/).
  > Note: Mac users will need to get `watchman` as well! It's mentioned in the docs!
- If you want to test the app directly on your phone, get the Expo Client app installed on your device! Find it on [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/expo-client/id982107779) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=en_CA).

Once all of the above is setup and installed:

1. Clone this repo and navigate to it.
2. Run `expo start` or `yarn start`. This will open a browser with a helpful Expo dashboard to monitor and run simulators of the app.
3. On the left side control panel, choose your mobile simulator or open up your phone's QR scanner to see the app in action!
